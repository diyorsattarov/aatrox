# aatrox

In a universe where genetic engineering has reached unprecedented heights, "Aatrox" explores a speculative realm of biotechnology that grants organisms the power to adapt, enhance, and even reset their own genetic blueprint. This code simulates three core mechanisms of this genetic mastery:

- **Revive (`revive.c`)**: The power of genetic activation. Here, dormant genes lie in wait, triggered to life by environmental stimuli. These activations grant organisms resilience, evolving them in real-time for hostile or extreme conditions.

- **Transcend (`transcend.c`)**: The temporary enhancement. Through epigenetic modifications, traits can be unlocked and suppressed on demand, enabling beings to ascend beyond their limits, whether for a burst of strength, heightened senses, or unmatched agility. These enhancements are fleeting, leaving no lasting alteration on the core DNA.

- **Rebirth (`rebirth.c`)**: Reversible evolution. In this universe, even permanent modifications to DNA can be undone, allowing for a true “rebirth” to a previous state. Here, life forms can trial new adaptations, safely return to a baseline, and thus explore boundless genetic diversity without losing their original identity.

Together, these files form a blueprint for dynamic and adaptive life forms, unbound by the static constraints of traditional evolution and capable of transformation on demand. If fully realized, Aatrox’s technology would revolutionize the concept of “life,” where genetic identity becomes as fluid as the mind that wields it.
